# C++ Variations

Snippets of C++ code illustrating various techniques

I wrote these files a generation ago to show possible
C++ programming techniques with the understanding that
they would need to be altered and polished for any real
applications.  As such, they are NOT intended to be
directly applicable to any programming problem and in
no event is anyone to be held liable for their failure
to meet any purpose.

Some of the techniques shown here are still little
known.  The C++ Standard and C++ Practice have both
advanced since the time these examples were written,
allowing for additional improvements.

I am increasingly moving to Rust for systems programming
so I'm unlikely to put much more work on these examples
yet I would be happy to entertain your pull requests!

Thanks,

Greg Davidson
