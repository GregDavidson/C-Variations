# C++ Variations

Snippets of C++ code illustrating various techniques

I wrote these files a generation ago to show possible
C++ programming techniques with the understanding that
they would need to be altered and polished for any real
applications.  As such, they are NOT intended to be
directly applicable to any programming problem and in
no event is anyone to be held liable for their failure
to meet any purpose.

Some of the techniques shown here are still little
known.  If you find these examples useful or inspiring
I would appreciate your attributing them in your code
with the URL of this repository and I certainly do not
require that you do so.

These examples can certainly be improved, in particular
to include advances in the C++ Standard and C++ Practice.
As I am increasingly moving to Rust for systems programming
I'm unlikely to do much more work myself and I would be
happy to entertain your pull requests!

Thanks,

Greg Davidson
